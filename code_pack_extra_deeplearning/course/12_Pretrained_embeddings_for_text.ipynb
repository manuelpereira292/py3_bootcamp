    "In the last part of [Lab 8](./08_NLP_and_Text_Data.ipynb#Embeddings) we introduced the concept of **Embeddings**. These are dense vectors that represent words and are often used as a starting point when approaching NLP problems like language translation or sentiment analysis. The word vectors we introduced in Lab 8 were trained together with the rest of the model and therefore were specific to the particular problem we were trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when we trained our [Recurrent Model](./08_NLP_and_Text_Data.ipynb#Recurrent-model) for the IMDB sentiment analysis task, the embedding layer was the first layer in a Sequential model, followed by a recurrent layer and a classification head for the sentiment prediction. The weights of the word vectors in the embedding layer were learned together with the weights of the recurrent layer and the classification layer. The single task of predicting the sentiment of a movie review would provide a value for the loss which would then propagate back through the network to adjust both the recurrent and the embedding weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we have just described has two drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) since the embedding layer has many of weights (e.g., for a vocabulary of 10k words, each embedded with 100 numbers, we have 1M weights), we need lots of data for this model to generalize well and avoid overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "2) since the embeddings are trained on the sentiment analysis task, they will work well on that task but will not necessarily learn general properties of the semantic space. In other words, we will not be able to use those same embeddings for an entirely different NLP task, like machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these two limitations, researchers have proposed a different approach to building more generic embeddings. These approaches try to capture the meaning of a word in a language and learn more general embeddings where similar vectors represent words with similar meanings. Although this may seem crazy at first, it works well in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will see a couple of different famous embeddings, and we will use them to do fun operations with text.\n",

    "How can we train a generic embedding layer that encodes the meaning of words? We'll have to resort to a trick, common when training large networks. This trick is often referred to as \"Unsupervised Learning\" although, as we shall see, it is a special case of Supervised Learning where humans do not generate the labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think back of the [sequence generation](./08_NLP_and_Text_Data.ipynb#Sequence-generation-and-language-modeling) example we introduced in Lab 8. There we built a network that learned to predict the most likely letter after a sequence of 3 letters, using a corpus of English baby names. The same approach can be used to build a model that is trained to predict the most likely word after a sequence of words. For example, if trained using a corpus of songs from John Lennon, the model should be able to learn that \"heaven\" should be the most likely word after the words \"imagine there's no\". This task is called **language modeling** because the model learns the structure of a language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this model is a Softmax over the vocabulary of the language, while the input is a sequence of words encoded as vectors by the input embedding layer of the language model. Since the model is solving a forecasting task (predict the most likely words after a sequence of words), we are still in the domain of Supervised Learning. The labels, however, are contained in the corpus itself.\n",

Each word corresponds to a vector with fifty numbers and words that carry similar semantic value will be encoded with similar vectors. As we shall see, GloVe vectors are built by looking at co-occurrence of words, so the above plots tell us that numbers like two, three and four are often found near to each other, which makes sense since they appear in similar contexts. I can say: \"I ran _two_ miles\" or \"I ran _three_ miles\" and both sentences make sense, while I cannot say \"I ran _cat_ miles\". _Two_ and _three_ can be found in similar contexts and therefore are encoded as similar vectors.\n",
